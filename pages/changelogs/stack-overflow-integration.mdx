We believe the value of crowd.dev lies in the rich integrations we offer, 
and we're committed to expanding our library. 
Our aim is to ship at least one new integration every month, 
and this week, we're proud to announce the addition of Stack Overflow to our ever-growing list!

### Sync Stack Overflow questions and answers
With the new Stack Overflow integration, you can seamlessly sync questions and 
answers directly into your workspace. 
You can use two methods to find the perfect questions for your community: tag-based searches or keyword matching.

- **Comprehensive tag-based searching**: every Stack Overflow question comes with a tag,
and our integration allows you to combine these tags to access your community's most relevant questions. 
When you provide multiple tags, you'll receive questions that match any of them,
ensuring you get all the valuable insights.

- **Precise keyword matching**: for a more targeted approach, use keyword matching to find questions 
that precisely match your chosen keywords. 
For instance, searching for "crowd.dev" will return any question containing that exact term.

### Keep your selection lean and focused
We encourage you to maintain a lean selection to ensure your data accurately represents your community.
Broad tag selections may result in irrelevant data, cluttering your workspace.
To help you avoid this, we'll display a warning if we detect your selection might be too broad.

### What's next?
We have already planned improvements for this integration, including syncing comments from each question and answer.
Stay tuned for these enhancements!

## Elevate your members with multiple emails <PullRequest number="632"/>
As crowd.dev continues to grow, we've noticed an increasing demand for members to be associated with multiple emails.
To meet this need, we modified members' profiles to accept a list of emails.
This feature also accommodates additional emails returned during member enrichment.
