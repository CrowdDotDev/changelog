We are excited to announce the release of a highly anticipated feature - the ability to sync your community data with Hubspot. This integration will allow you to selectively sync members and organizations from your community to Hubspot, providing your sales team with the ability to harness the full potential of your community.

## Send your community data to Hubspot

If you send your community data to Hubspot, you can provide your go-to-market team with valuable insights. This integration allows them to receive qualified leads based on the data you provide. For example, if an organization has many active members in your community, it may be a promising commercial opportunity.

With the Hubspot integration, you can automatically synchronize community data by applying specific criteria. This makes the process easier and enables you to filter and target the most relevant members for your marketing efforts. Some examples of specific criteria include a member who has completed more than ten activities, a member who has conducted a specific activity like opening a pull request, or a member who has a specific attribute like being a senior developer or a team lead.

In addition, you can also enrich your existing Hubspot contacts with community data. This means that you can sync their identities from different platforms and the attributes you gather from integrations and enrichment.

## Enrich your community members with Hubspot data

Our integration works both ways, allowing you to enrich your community members and organizations with Hubspot data.

By syncing contacts using email addresses, we can match Hubspot contacts with community members and enrich their data. The same process applies to organizations, where we match based on name.
