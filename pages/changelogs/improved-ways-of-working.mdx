We don't have major product updates this week, but we are setting ourselves up internally to ship even more.

Last week we had our team offsite in Croatia. We had a great time together, which is essential for a distributed team like ours.
However, there was also time for meaningful work. We had extended discussions about how we work and reached some fascinating conclusions that will impact the product immensely.

### Open and better documentation

One area that will benefit our users, our contributors, and our team is improving our documentation.
We currently need to be using more tools to document our work, which causes confusion and makes it hard to find the correct information
or to keep it up to date. We will centralize all of our documentation into one tool.

We also believe in the power of openness, so we will make as much of our documentation public as possible.
There is a lot of valuable information in our technical and internal processes documentation that could be useful
to our contributors, users, or even fellow open-source projects. We will be working on making it accessible to everyone.

### Workshops and knowledge sharing

We have a lot of knowledge in our team, and we want to ensure everyone can benefit from it. Even within the team,
we still need ways to transfer knowledge between members. We will organize regular workshops, where someone from the team
will present a topic they are knowledgeable about. We will cover both technical and non-technical topics.

When possible, we will also share these workshops with our community to benefit everyone.

### Monitoring and infrastructure

We have identified that we need to improve our monitoring to make crowd.dev more reliable and stable. We will be working on
implementing a monitoring solution will allow us to detect issues before they happen and react to them faster.

### Areas of ownership

We have a lot of fantastic ideas for how to bring crowd.dev forward, and we want to make sure that we are working on the
right things and quality does not suffer.
We will define ownership areas for each team member, so everyone knows what they are responsible for and what they can work on.
This will also help us ensure that each crucial product area gets its love and attention.

## Fast active members' widgets

Following on from last week's speed update, we have made another improvement to the speed of the widgets that show active members.
This widget is important in the home dashboard and the members' default report and it is now loading much faster.
