This week we have some super exciting updates. We are introducing Eagle Eye 2.0: a better way to grow your developer tool by engaging with relevant content.

With a refreshed user interface and several new features, Eagle Eye 2.0 will help you find and engage with the perfect content in your niche. Below are some of the highlights:

### New user interface

We have redesigned the user interface to make setting up your feed and discovering relevant content easier.

### More platforms

Eagle Eye now supports 11 of the most relevant platforms for developer tools. You can now access content from Reddit, GitHub discussions, Tweets, Medium posts, Stack Overflow questions, DEV and Hacker News posts, YouTube videos, Producthunt discussions, Kaggle discussions, and Hashnode articles.

### Better search

We have improved the search algorithm to give you more relevant results. You can now exclude certain keywords from your search, enabling you to tailor your results further.

### Email digest

Stay up-to-date with your Eagle Eye feed by configuring an email digest that delivers a daily feed to your inbox. This feature will help you to make growth a daily routine.
