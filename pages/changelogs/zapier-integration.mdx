We are introducing the crowd.dev Zapier integration, which will enable you to automate your community workflows and connect crowd.dev with over 3,000 apps.

The Zapier connector is not in the Zapier marketplace yet. To begin using the integration, follow the [invitation link](https://app.crowd.dev/integrations) provided in the Integration settings of the crowd.dev app.

### Supported Triggers

With this integration, you can set up two triggers: **New Activity** and **New Member**. You could use these triggers to sync your members to Hubspot or CRM,
to send a message to your Discord channel when a new member joins, to notify you internally when there is an activity with negative sentiment, or to send a welcome email to new members.

### Supported Actions

The crowd.dev Zapier integration includes various actions for Activities, Members, Organizations, Tasks, and Notes.
You can see the complete list of actions in [our docs](https://docs.crowd.dev/docs/zapier-integration#supported-actions).

You can use the Zapier integration to add members and activities from a Google Sheet, a CSV file, or another source not supported by crowd.dev.
For example, we recently added activities and members from our OSS drinks in Berlin using the [Luma connector](https://zapier.com/apps/luma/integrations#page=6).

By leveraging the crowd.dev Zapier integration, you can create more efficient workflows, improve collaboration, and automate processes within your community.

## Better merge suggestions <PullRequest number="715">

We have completely redesigned the user experience for members' merge suggestions. The new UX is more intuitive and allows you to merge members faster.
Now we show you the full context that you need to determine whether two members should be merged immediately without opening the member profiles.
We hope the new design will make the experience of merging members more enjoyable and productive.
