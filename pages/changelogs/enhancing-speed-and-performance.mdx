This week, our team dedicated its efforts to long-term work and essential optimizations. We recognize that the current weaknesses of our app are its speed and maturity. That’s why we are focusing our efforts almost exclusively on addressing these issues, as we believe that enhancing the app's performance at the moment will deliver more value to our users than new features or improvements alone.

## Improving the speed of our app

We are adding Open Search into our stack to offer you snappy filtering on your community members. We have been doing performance tests, and the results are very encouraging. Our goal is to release this enhancement within the next two weeks and eventually roll it out for organizations and activities as well.

## More integrations transformed to the new framework

Last week, we announced a more reliable and performant integration framework. We have now also migrated the Stack Overflow, Reddit, and HackerNews integrations to the new framework, in addition to LinkedIn and DEV that were already there. As a result, you can expect improved performance and reliability across the platform.
