This week we did a deep dive in the metrics and the data that crowd.dev shows. Having sound and complete data is crucial for you to get the value of crowd.dev,
and we realised there were some areas of the product that were falling behind. We fixed most of them.

## Correct metrics in home and reports <PullRequest number="1391"/>

Some widgets were showing the wrong data in the home dashboard and reports section.
We went through all inconsistencies, and made sure everything was aligned.
These metrics refresh every ten minutes, so if you see small inconsistencies it's due to the refresh period.

## Only show active members in an organziation's profile <PullRequest number="1381"/>

Up until now, an organization's profile showed all the memebrs that had ever been a part of that organization,
even if that organization had never done any activity in your community.
We switched it to only show a member in the organization's profile if they are currently active in the organization.
This gives you more accurate information.

## Performance optimizations for integrations <PullRequest number="1380"/>

Last week we found ourselves having to ingest a lot of data through integrations, and we hit a bottleneck.
We spent the week optimizing, making sure every single query that is made when ingesting data was efficient,
and that the database could handle the load.
The result is a much faster and performant integration framework, and thus more consistent and reliable data for you.

## Display manually created members and organizations <PullRequest number="1383"/>

When you create members and organizations manually, even if they do not have any activity, they will be displayed on their respective directories. Until now, we were filtering for members and organizations with any activity; we have added a new overriding filter to ensure those members and organizations appear on the list, filterable and searchable.

## Other Bug Fixes and Improvements

- Support versioned index and improve name search. <PullRequest number="1378"/>
- Consistent timestamps throughout the app. <PullRequest number="1375"/>
- Process events without deduplication ID. <PullRequest number="1385"/>
- Increased performance when ingesting data. <PullRequest number="1380"/>
- Prevent unnecessary name updates when ingesting data. <PullRequest number="1372"/>
