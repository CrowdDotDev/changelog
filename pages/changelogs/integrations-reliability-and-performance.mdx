This week, we've been putting much effort into making integration a smoother experience for everyone.
There have been several integrations erroring lately, and we want to sort that out for you.

While we're addressing these issues individually, we're also looking at the big picture,
working on making our data synchronization framework more robust and reliable.
We're digging into what's causing these problems and starting to fix them from the ground up.

Even if our framework gets better, there might still be occasional issues with integrations since they rely on the source's external APIs
working smoothly. We are also focusing on finding better ways to deal with those
temporary situations and reporting and communicating those errors with you better.

Although we're still getting ready to roll out these improvements, we're making good progress and are excited
to share them with you soon. Thanks for your patience and understanding as we work on improving things for everyone.

This improvement will also make our integration framework much more developer-friendly. We will ship good documentation
soon so that you can contribute your integrations. Making this good enough has been a long-term goal for us, and we are
getting closer. Stay tuned for more updates!
