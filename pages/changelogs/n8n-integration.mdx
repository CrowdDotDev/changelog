We are happy to announce the crowd.dev n8n integration! This integration allows you to streamline your community workflows and integrate crowd.dev with a broad range of apps. The n8n integration can automate routine tasks and alert you to important events in your community. Similar to our Zapier integration, n8n offers a multitude of use cases. To start using it, access the Integration settings of the crowd.dev app and follow the steps to set up n8n.

### Supported Triggers

Triggers are defined events that take place in your community that fire a n8n automation. With this integration, you can set up two triggers: "New Activity" and "New Member." These triggers allow you to, for example, sync your community members to different CRMs, send a message to your Discord channel when a new member joins, notify you internally when negative sentiment activity occurs, send a welcome email to new members, and much more!

### Supported Actions

Actions are defined tasks that can be performed within your workflows. The crowd.dev n8n integration includes various actions for Activities, Members, Organizations, Notes, and Tasks. For instance, using the n8n integration, you can add activities, members, and organizations to crowd.dev from different sources not supported directly by integrations. See our docs for a complete list of the supported actions.

We hope n8n will help your productivity, promote collaboration, and automate processes within your community. We can't wait to see all the creative ways you'll use it, and we are eager to hear your feedback!
