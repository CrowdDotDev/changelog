This week, we released a much-improved work history view of your community members. Previously, we displayed current organizations your members belong to. However, this gave you no information about the start and end dates of their employement, as well as previous employers.

Knowing where and when a member worked at a given organization, can be very important for a number of reasons. Firstly, identifying heavily represented or new organizations that match your ideal customer profile is crucial for your DevTool growth strategy. Secondly, you may want to know which organization stood behind which activity of a community member. Did they always interact with your business while employed at Organization A, or was it partly at Organization B? Are they long-standing employees at an organization or new hires?
Being able to answer these questions can help you better understand if, when, and how to reach out to a community member or an organization.

With our new update, the relationship between members and organizations is time-dependent. That means when you use our enrichment feature, you will see the whole employment history, including job titles and dates, in the organization’s field. You will also be able to edit this work experience manually if needed. As always, for enrichment to work, make sure your member has either an email or a GitHub profile linked.

### Next Steps - Automatic organization-activity affiliation

Currently, you will still need to infer yourself, based on the displayed work history, which organization a community member belonged to when they performed an activity. However, soon we will automatically affiliate members' activities to the organization where they belonged to when the activity happened. This will be kept up to date as the member moves jobs or as we find out more information about them, giving you a complete picture of the activity of each organization in your community.

Knowing which organizations did community activities will help you better categorize them. Since it will also work for historical activities, you will get an excellent signal for which companies have developers with the most interest in your community. This is crucial to uncover hidden sales opportunities. So keep your eyes peeled!
