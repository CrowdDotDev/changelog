This week we have great news for our outstanding contributors! We have refactored a big part of the front end that will make the experience
of developing crowd.dev much more enjoyable. We have entirely simplified how filtering works; now it's just a matter of adding some configuration to add a new filter. We have also replaced Webpack with Vite, making the development experience seamless.

## New filter framework

The new filter framework will make adding new filters much faster and more reliable.

What does this mean for you as a user? This release will squash several bugs we have been having on filters for some time. You should now notice a much smoother experience when filtering your community members, activities, and organizations.

For our contributors, we will soon add complete documentation to help you add new filters to crowd.dev.

## Replaced Webpack with Vite <PullRequest number="982"/>

We also replaced Webpack with Vite.
Vite is a build tool that leverages the native ES module import system to provide a swift development server and build pipeline. It also supports hot module replacement out of the box, which makes the development experience much more enjoyable.
The time to build our frontend image has decreased from seven to just over two minutes. Compiling now takes one second, and hot reloading is instant.

## Final push with improving the speed of our app

We are in the final sprint of improving the querying speed of crowd.dev. We are in the final stage of developing and testing the Open Search layer for fast filtering. We will deploy it in the next two days.
We will share the news in next week's release!
