We are working on our activity affiliations, with the end-goal to match each activity with the organization that performed it.

Knowing which organizations did community activities will help you better categorize them. Since it will also work for historical activities, you will get an excellent signal for which companies have developers with the most interest in your community. This is crucial to uncover hidden sales opportunities.
The first step for being able to perform activity affiliation is to understand the whole work experience of each community member.

### Work experience for members

This week we focused on understanding and displaying the work experience of members, which is the first step to having proper activity affiliations.

Until now, when our integrations or enrichment caught an organization for a member, they were automatically related in crowd.dev. However, this gave you no information about the start or end dates of their employment with the organization. We also did not know where the member worked before.

This update has transformed the relationship between members and organizations to make it time-dependent. When you enrich a member, you will see their whole employment history, including job titles and dates, in the organization's field. You will also be able to edit this work experience manually.

### Next steps

Soon we will be to affiliate members' activities to the organization where they were active when the activity happened. This will be kept up to date as the member moves jobs or as we find out more information about them, giving you a complete picture of the activity of each organization in your community.
