Today is the most heartwarming update we've ever released.
While our core team is busy with long-term goals, this week's product growth was driven by our community.
We would not be celebrating two significant product updates without their incredible efforts.

It is truly inspiring to see our gifted external contributors leading the growth of our platform.
We can't thank them enough for their commitment and invaluable input, which keeps our product flourishing.

We have started a [dedicated community page](https://www.crowd.dev/community) to celebrate all our outstanding contributors.
We will recognize code contributors as well as feedback champions.

## Highlighting Open Source Contributions

This week's major update aims to make these incredible contributions more accessible to every community and foster contributor growth.

Identifying the members more likely to contribute is crucial to growing your code contributions. To measure this, we are introducing the **number of open-source contributions** attribute for members,
which measures how many code contributions they have made to any project.
You can filter and sort members by it in the members' directory.

We recommend reaching out to these members, understanding their needs from your community, and giving them the best possible contributor onboarding.

## Filtering Activities by Type and Channel

You can also filter by channels now in crowd.dev.
Channels are the medium in which the activity occurs within the source (repositories in GitHub or channels in Discord and Slack).

With this filter, you can get much more granularity in analyzing your community's activity.
For example, you can find the stargazers for a specific repository and messages in your support channel.

The following steps will be to add this same filter to the members' directory to unlock insights like "members who have contributed to this repository." Stay tuned!
