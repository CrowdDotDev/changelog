Today’s update is a particularly special one for us. While our core team is busy with longer-term features, this week's product releases were driven by our community.

We would not be celebrating two significant updates without their incredible efforts. It is truly inspiring to see our gifted external contributors leading the growth of our platform. We can't thank them enough for their commitment, which keeps our product flourishing.

We have started a [dedicated community page](https://www.crowd.dev/community) to celebrate them. We will recognize code contributors as well as feedback champions.

## Highlighting Open Source Contributions

Fittingly, this week's update aims to make these incredible contributions more accessible to every community and foster contributor growth.

Identifying community members that are more likely to contribute is crucial to growing your code contributions. To enable this, we are introducing the **number of open-source contributions** attribute for your community members. This attribute measures how many code contributions they have made to any project. You can filter and sort members by it in the members' directory.

Once you have identified these community members. We recommend reaching out to them, understanding their needs from your community, and giving them the best possible contributor onboarding.

## Filtering Activities by Type and Channel

You can now also filter by channels in crowd.dev. Channels are the medium in which the activity occurs within the source (repositories in GitHub or channels in Discord and Slack).

  maxWidth="100%"
/>

With this filter, you can get much more granular in analyzing your community's activity. For example, you can find the stargazers for a specific repository and messages in your support channel.

Our next step will be to add this filter to the members' directory to unlock insights like "members who have contributed to this repository." Stay tuned!
