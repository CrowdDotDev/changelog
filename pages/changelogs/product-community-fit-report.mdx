A strong connection with your developer community is crucial, especially for open-source and developer-first companies.
Achieving Product-Community Fit (PCF) means understanding your target community's needs, desires, and values and ensuring your product addresses them.
We have introduced a new report to help you measure and track PCF.

### Measuring Product-Community Fit 

Developing a measure for PCF can be challenging since it depends on your product, target community, and industry... But for companies with an open-source core, we've identified that Monthly Active Contributors can serve as an excellent success indicator.

### Introducing the Product-Community Fit Report
The new Product-Community Fit report measures PCF for you by tracking Monthly Active Contributors across all community platforms.

The report will show you the evolution of your Monthly Active Contributors and benchmark your results against data from over 150,000 open-source repositories. You can also view which members were active contributors at any time.

Head to your Reports section to find the Product-Community Fit report to access your report. We've taken care of everything, so you can lean back and enjoy the insights!

### Share Your PCF Report with Investors and Stakeholders
Demonstrating the effectiveness of your Product-Community Fit can be a game-changer in securing funding, generating interest, and validating your project.
We have added sharing functionality so you can send the report to investors, team members, and other stakeholders.
