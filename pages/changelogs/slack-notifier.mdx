Fast reaction times to community activities can enable more lively discussion, assist struggling users, or quickly combat negative sentiment. That’s why we’ve made staying on top of important (to you) community activities much more effortless.

We already built webhook-based automation to help you set up your notification flow. But we needed the most crucial channel: Slack. Today we are releasing our Slack-based notifier bot. After installing our new notifier bot on your internal Slack channel, you can set up notifications for new members and activities.

If you want to learn how to set up Slack notifications for your crowd.dev workspace, [take a look at our docs](https://docs.crowd.dev/docs/slack-notifications).


### New members

Knowing when new members join your workspace helps to build a solid community. Reaching out to them will make them feel welcome and increase their odds of becoming an avid community member.

You can filter by the platform on which they joined. For example, you may only want to get notifications for new Discord and Linkedin members since you can take direct action and message them.

### New activities

There are specific activities where you want to take action fast. New messages on Discord, questions asked in forums, issues opened on GitHub. Having a fast response time will keep your community happy and productive. The notifier for activities can ping you whenever a relevant activity happens on any platform.

We added filters for platform and activity type. For example, you could get notifications for new GitHub issues and pull requests, but not stargazers. We are also exploring other powerful filters to add in the future. These include activity channels, so you can, for example, get pinged for activity on your support channels only, and sentiment, so you can quickly react to activities with negative sentiment.
