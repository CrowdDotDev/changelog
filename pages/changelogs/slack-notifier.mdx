Getting up-to-date notifications about your community's activity can be truly helpful.
It is important to take action when someone joins your community or when a relevant activity happens.
A few months ago, we built webhook-based automation to help you set up your notification flows. But we were missing the most important channel of all: Slack.
Today we are bringing a Slack-based notifier.
After installing our new notifier app on the Slack channel of your choice, you can set up notifications for new members and activities.

### New members

Knowing when new members join your workspace is pivotal to building a solid community.
Reaching out to them will make them feel welcome and significantly increase the odds of becoming an avid community member.

You can also filter by the platform on which they joined. For example, you might want to get notifications for new Discord and Linkedin members,
since you can take direct action and message them.

### New activities

There are specific activities where you want to take action fast. New messages on Discord, questions asked in forums, issues opened on GitHub.
Having a fast response time will keep your community happy and productive. The notifier for activities can ping you whenever a relevant activity happens on any platform.

We added filters for platform and activity type. For example, you could get notifications for new GitHub issues and pull requests, but not stargazers.
We are exploring other powerful filters to add in the future, such as activity channel so that you can get pinged on for activity on your support channels only,
and sentiment, so you can quickly react to activities with negative sentiment.
