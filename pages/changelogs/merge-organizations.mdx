We have been working on improvements to organizations over the last several weeks. And today, we bring you a big one. You can now merge organizations in crowd.dev!

When you notice two organizations repeated, you can select and merge them into one. We will keep the information from both organizations and when there is a conflict, the primary organization will take priority. The members and activities of the two organizations will then belong to the newly created organization. Note that, for now, this change is not reversible; therefore, please be careful when doing merges and only do so when it's clear both organizations are the same.

We will soon start working on merge suggestions for organizations, just like we do for members.
