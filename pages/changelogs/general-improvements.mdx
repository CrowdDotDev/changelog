A strong product should have great features, but it will only be phenomenal if the UX is perfect. Sometimes the tiniest things make the most significant difference.
Lately, we have been focusing on new features: we quickly released Eagle Eye, member enrichment, and the new Home page. However, we
overlooked some minor details that made the product feel more polished. This week we brought those details to the forefront.

## Editing of members' multi-select attributes in the UI <PullRequest number="593"/>

With member enrichment, we also introduced multi-select attributes for members.
These attributes are useful for lists with limited options, like skills, interests, or languages.
Since we wanted to bring enrichment to you as soon as possible, we decided to make them temporarily read-only.

Nevertheless, information from enrichment might not be perfect, and you should be able to edit it.
You can now do so from the UI.

Having multi-select attributes as read-only was also unblocking other features requested by our users, like making the _location_ attribute a multi-select.
We will be working on this soon!

## Improvements to organizations

Having correct and clean data is crucial to get value from crowd.dev.
Things like having team members set up correctly and having perfect consistency among the members of an organization can make a difference.

### Marking organizations as team members <PullRequest number="602"/>

You can now mark a whole organization as being part of your team. Doing so will mark all members of the organization as team members.
All related members and activities will be ignored when computing your community metrics.
For example, your organization will no longer be the most active.

### Hide members that are organizations (from LinkedIn) <PullRequest number="605"/>

LinkedIn treats organizations and people similarly. Often, you will have your own organization's account commenting on your posts.
When that happens crowd.dev will create a member for your organization. But you may want to avoid seeing your organization as a community member.
These are now hidden from the UI by default and ignored when computing metrics.

## Re-enrich a member <PullRequest number="594"/>

We refresh enrichment data every quarter. For key members, you might want to re-enrich them more often to answer questions like their current job or location.
You can now re-enrich members that were enriched in the past.

## Alerting for integrations <PullRequest number="616"/>

We are working hard to have a reliable integration framework, but some errors are unavoidable.
We have been working on a new alerting system for integrations.
When an integration has not received the data we are expecting from it, we will now send you an alert in the UI.
We also built an internal Slack alerting system, so if it does not behave as expected, we will be notified and can take action quickly.

## Other bug fixes and improvements

- We improved the performance of searching for members by adding a pagination limit to the request. <PullRequest number="587"/>

- You can now open members in a new tab from the members' list (right-click + Open in new tab). <PullRequest number="577"/>

- We replaced the partner logos to show the most up-to-date state. <PullRequest number="581"/>

- If you leave the page after searching for members, the query is re-added to the initial state when coming back. <PullRequest number="603"/>

- When a member has multiple organizations, show them all in the UI. <PullRequest number="608"/>

- Sometimes, the GitHub integration needs an admin's approval. When this happens, you will be alerted by the UI to invite the admin instead of saying the integration is _in progress_. <PullRequest number="601"/>

- We fixed a bug where enriched members could not be merged. This is now fixed. <PullRequest number="588"/>

- We made some changes to the Slack integration. Before, we created an activity every time a member joined a channel.
  This caused the joined activity to be repeated. We not only create one such activity per member. <PullRequest number="582"/>

- Members' emails can now be edited from the UI. <PullRequest number="598"/>

- We moved user management back to the free tier in the self-hosted version. <PullRequest number="599"/>
