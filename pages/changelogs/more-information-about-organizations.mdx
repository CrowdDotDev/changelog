Organization data enrichment is one of the most insightful features of crowd.dev. When an Organization is represented in your developer community we automatically enrich it with extra data. This week, it is reaching a whole new level! We have expanded the number of data points we can get and display in an Organization profileto give you more in depth information about the companies in your community.

### Revenue

Revenue is an important data point your go-to-market team will need to qualify companies. We are now getting estimated revenue data for all companies in your community.

### Employee metrics

We have expanded the metrics we get for the employees of each company way beyond the absolute number of employees. You can get the growth rate, the number of employees per month in the past, the number of employees per country, and more.

You can also get insights into the ability of companies to keep their employees and the flux of people in and out. We have metrics on the employee churn rate, the average contract duration, and the number of people joining and leaving the company every month.


### Parent and subsidiary companies

You can now have information on parent and subsidiary companies of organizations in your community to identify relations between companies. For now, we are giving you the names of those companies, but in future iterations, we will create relations between the companies in the app.

Organization enrichment is a feature for our Growth and Custom plans. If you are interested please don't hesitate to reach out or [schedule a call with us](https://cal.com/team/crowddotdev/custom-plan).
