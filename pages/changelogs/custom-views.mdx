Our filter capabilities on the contacts and organizations' directories became much more powerful! Until now, you could make any filter you wanted, but it was not possible to save it or combine multiple views within the app.
Furthermore, the only possible way to share it with your team was to share the URL. Today, we are introducing the ability to save and share these filters with custom views. These views will add an extra layer of flexibility to the product. You can segment your data as you need, going beyond our pre-made segmentations.
You can easily find your ideal customer contacts and organizations according to your definition and data.

### Creating custom views

Once you have a filter you are happy with, you can simply save it into a view. Give it a name, and you are done! You can also further personalize settings, such as whether to include or exclude team contacts or organizations, bots… Alternatively, you can create a view from scratch by clicking the plus button on the top-right corner of contacts or organizations directories.

You can edit the view afterward by changing the filter and clicking the _Save as_ button or editing the view through the _Manage views_ section.

  maxWidth="100%"
/>

### Sharing with your team

We have added the ability to share your views with your whole workspace so you can create organization-wide pre-set filters. For example, if your
main ICP is technical executives, and one of your primary channels is LinkedIn; you could create such a view for everyone in your organization.

Views are private to you by default. To make them shared, click on _Shared with workspace_ on creation.

We hope you get value from creating your own views and sharing them with the team. As always, if you have any questions or feedback, please contact us!
