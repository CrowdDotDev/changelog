We are delighted to introduce our Discourse integration this week!
For those using Discourse as a community platform, this feature enables a seamless integration into your crowd.dev workspace. Now you can effortlessly sync topics, posts, and replies,
providing a comprehensive view of your community's interactions.

### Sync members and activities to crowd.dev

This integration maps Discourse topics, posts, and replies to activities in your workspace.
It also imports users participating in discussions as community members,
getting helpful information such as their location, website URL, and bio.

### Connect Discourse to crowd.dev with ease

Get started quickly by providing your API key and configuring webhooks,
allowing you to connect your Discourse instance. For a more detailed step-by-step
walkthrough, you can refer to our [docs](https://docs.crowd.dev/docs/discourse-integration).
