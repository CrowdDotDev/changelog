We often get the email addresses of members. When we detect that the email address belongs to an existing organization in your community, we affiliate the member to the organization. Until now, when the organization did not exist, we did nothing.

Now, we will create it and affiliate the member to the organization, and new members with the same email domain will also be linked. The number of members that belong to organizations will increase, and the potential for enriching organizations becomes even higher, thus taking one more step in getting the most out of your data.


## Problems with integrations and stability

Lately, we have been suffering from some stability and data issues. We are working internally to address those and preparing long-term changes to leave them behind for good.

We are finishing the last planning touches, and you will hear from us next week with proper communication about the causes of the issues, the solution, and our goals.
