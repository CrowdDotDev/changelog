As companies grow and get more users, they should have a page that informs them of operational status and known incidents. These pages are essential to the users to quickly diagnose if problems they are experiencing are known and being worked on and if they are in the team's control.

This week, we are introducing our status page: [status.crowd.dev](https://status.crowd.dev). We will be informing you of the status of our API, including whether it is operational and statistics about the last 40 days. 

We also have an incident reporting feature, where we will make announcements if we have issues in other parts of the system, such as the data pipeline. If such issues occur, we will post live updates and report on our estimated times to fix them. 

As always, feedback on other things you might want on this page is deeply appreciated.
