Many of us spend a lot of time on Slack and use it as our real-time messaging and notification system. This makes it an ideal place to stay in the loop for the most important developer activities or signals in your community. Our crowd.dev Slack notifications enable just that, but they needed a bit of love. This week, we introduced a fresh design for Slack notifications that is much cleaner and more informative.

For new developers in your community, we will show a beautiful display of the job title and organization, reach, location, email, engagement level, and the platforms they are active on. You will also have clear links to the profile in crowd.dev and GitHub and their profile picture. You have everything needed to craft a nice welcome message or dig a little deeper to see whether they or their organization fit your ICP.

For new activities, we will show a clear display of the activity type and any content in the activity. You will also get the same information as the member who did the activity.

We are excited for you to experience these revamped notifications and act on them! Let us know what you think or if you have any further needs we can cover. We will be busy working on more notification and automation types for you as well.
