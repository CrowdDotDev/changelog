Slack is where many of us spend most of our time, and getting Slack notifications about events that matter to us can be a great way to stay in the loop organically and constantly. We consider Slack notifications to be one of the primary value drivers of crowd.dev, but they needed some love. This week, we are introducing a fresh design for Slack notifications that is cleaner and more informative.

For new members, we will show a beautiful display of the job title and organization, reach, location, email, engagement level, and the platforms they are active on. You will also have clear links to the profile in crowd.dev and GitHub and their profile picture.

For new activities, we will show a clear display of the activity type and any content in the activity. You will also get the same information as the member who did the activity.

These updates will make the Slack notifications much more readable so you can extract all the value they offer.
