Gaining a deep understanding of the organizations taking interest in or adopting your product is essential for any robust community strategy. Grasping the makeup of your audience, uncovering hidden industry segments, and closing commercial deals with high community adoption companies can all significantly impact your growth trajectory.

We have supported community organizations for some time now, but the information provided was fairly basic, drawing upon what was available on GitHub. Today, we are enthralled to unveil an automated organization enrichment feature exclusive to our Growth customers, offering invaluable details such as company size, industry, and location.

### Sit back and let the enrichment work its magic

If you're a Growth customer, there's no need to lift a finger! We will automatically select 200 organizations, prioritizing those that are most active and joined the community recently, and enrich them with crucial insights. We'll refresh the list and run this process every month.

### What information can you expect?

Our automated enrichment provides a wealth of essential information:

- Headline: A succinct one-sentence description of the organization.
- Description: A more elaborate depiction of the organization's activities.
- Identities: Organization profiles on other platforms, such as Twitter, LinkedIn, and Crunchbase.
- Industry: The company's operational field, e.g., "Computer Software".
- Number of employees: A precise headcount working for the organization.
- Location: The organization's geographical site.
- Founded: The year the company was established.
- Size: A ballpark estimate of employee numbers.
- Type: Indicates whether the organization is private or public.

While we cannot guarantee every data point's availability, we are committed to providing as much information as possible.

### Maximize the impact of the enriched data

You can employ the enhanced data in numerous ways, for instance:

- Ascertain which industries adopting your community: Focus your efforts on the right audience.
- Grasp the size and scope of the organizations: Validate your go-to-market strategy or uncover hidden segments, factoring in both size and industry.
- Get to know their location nuances: Organize community events and meetups in relevant places.

With these new data insights at your disposal, we will soon release an organizations report to help you automatically address these questions and more. Stay tuned for that exciting update!
