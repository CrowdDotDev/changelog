In October, we introduced a brand-new version of [crowd.dev](https://crowd.dev).
The new product was received greatly by the community.
We got tons of great feedback from our users, and we iterated over and over to make the crowd.dev more mature.
We have learned much about how we deliver value over the past few months, and our vision for the product has sharpened.
This caused the home that we envisioned in October to be outdated; it was not what crowd.dev needed anymore. We decided to rebuild it.

### More emphasis on your community members and organizations

Members are the pillar of your community, and we wanted to make sure that they were the focus of the new home.
The first two widgets are not your new and most active members, side by side. No more tab switching to get a full picture of your members.

Organizations are another important part of your community. We wanted to make sure that they were also front and center.
You can see your new and your most active organizations at a glance.

### Direct links to reports

Sometimes you just need to see more numbers. We added a direct link to the members' report on the home page.
We will be adding more direct links as we release more default reports.

### Less focus on tasks

While tasks still have a place in the new home, they now have a less prominent role. The spotlight should be on your community.

## Introducing our new changelog

Some products make us wait for their weekly changelog like a kid for their birthday,
like [June.so](https://changelog.june.so) or the [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/).
One thing all these changelogs have in common is that they are clean, visually appealing, and easy to read.
Our GitHub changelog was far from that. That is why we built a new changelog last week, starting from [June's open-source changelog](https://github.com/juneHQ/changelog).

### Tuesday is the new Monday

Until now, we had been announcing releases on Mondays. We will be moving it to Tuesday. No one needs another to-do item on Monday, and we want to make sure that you have time to read the changelog and try out the new features.
New releases will be published here every Tuesday morning.

## Other bug fixes and improvements

- Some attributes of members come from integrations and cannot be deleted, but they might not be relevant for you. You can now hide them in the UI. <PullRequest number="572" />
