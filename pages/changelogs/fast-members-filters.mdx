If you have been reading our changelog, you will have noticed that one of our main focuses the last weeks
was to improve the performance of accessing and filtering your community data, especially for the members' directory.

We are thrilled to announce filtering for your community members in under one second! The page should now feel snappy,
and when you change tabs in the member's directory, you will notice a close-to-instant behavior. This speed optimization is a massive improvement
for communities with many members, and we are excited to see how this will improve your experience with crowd.dev.

We achieved this by syncing all members' data to OpenSearch, an open-source distribution of Elastic Search.
OpenSearch allows us to query the data much faster, and we can now also implement more advanced filters in the future.
Next, we will build the same for the activities and organizations pages. Stay tuned!

## Faster integrations <PullRequest number="1026"/>

We also optimized how we check for the existence of community members when ingesting data from integrations. Integrations will now be faster.

With this fix and the deployment of OpenSearch, we have reduced the load on the database by half, resulting in a stable product
and a better experience for you.

## Moved the LinkedIn integration to the new API <PullRequest number="1035"/>

LinkedIn announced some weeks ago that they are deprecating the API we are using and introducing a new community API.

We have gotten access and moved the integration to the new API. However, this means you will have to re-authenticate
to continue getting LinkedIn data.
