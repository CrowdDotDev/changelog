We know how crucial it is to have accurate member identification in your community,
and that's why we have significantly improved our merging suggestions algorithm.
Our enhanced algorithm identifies potential merges more accurately and introduces a confidence score to help you make better decisions.

### More Accurate Member Merge Suggestions

Our improved algorithm analyzes members based on usernames and emails across different platforms, performing three types of checks:

1. Checking if two usernames are the same on different platforms.
2. Finding members that have overlapping emails.
3. Lastly, we check for members with similar usernames. For example, _bertram_gilfoyle_ and _gilfoyle_ would be matched.

This is a significant improvement from our previous algorithm,
which only checked for the same usernames across different platforms with low accuracy.

### Introducing Confidence Scoring

We also introduced a confidence score indicating our algorithm's certainty about the suggestion. This will aid you in making well-informed decisions about potential merges. Usually, anything above 80% is good to go!

It also opens the door for automatic merging. We are exploring different options, such as letting you set a minimum threshold above which two members would be automatically merged.

Stay tuned for more exciting updates from our team. In the meantime, happy merging!

## Multiple identities per member per platform

We also upgraded our data structure to support having multiple identities for a member on a single platform.

If you have two members you know to be the same on a single platform, you can merge them without any loss of information. The two identities will co-exist.
