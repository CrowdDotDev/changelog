Having unified member profiles in your community is crucial. It's the only way to have a unified view and a source of truth for your community data.
This week we significantly improved our merging suggestions algorithm: we identify potential merges more accurately and introduce a confidence score to help you make better decisions.

### More Accurate Member Merge Suggestions

Our improved algorithm analyzes members based on usernames and emails across different platforms, performing three types of checks:

1. Check if two members have identical usernames on different platforms.
2. Find members that have overlapping emails.
3. Lastly, we check for members with similar usernames. For example, _bertram_gilfoyle_ and _gilfoyle_ would be matched.

This is a significant improvement from our previous algorithm,
which only checked for the same usernames across different platforms with low accuracy.

### Introducing Confidence Scoring

We also added a confidence score indicating the algorithm's certainty about the suggestion.
This will aid you in making well-informed decisions about potential merges. Usually, any suggestion above 80% is good to go! You can learn more about the confidence score in our [docs](https://docs.crowd.dev/docs/merge-members-copy#the-algorithm-to-perform-merge-suggestions).

The confidence score also opens the door for automatic merging. We are exploring letting you set a minimum threshold above which two members would be automatically merged, to reduce the manual work to a minimum.

Stay tuned for more exciting updates. In the meantime, happy merging!

## Multiple identities per member per platform <PullRequest number="787"/>

We upgraded our data structure to support having multiple identities for a member on a single platform.

  maxWidth="100%"
/>

If you have two members you know to be the same on a single platform, you can merge them without any loss of information. The two identities will co-exist.

## See the number of activities in the member directory <PullRequest number="789"/>

We add a column to display the number of activities for all views in the member directory. You will be able to see at a glance how active the member is, and sort by this column.
