Community members in crowd.dev are now contacts! In the following months, crowd.dev will evolve from supporting only community data to a holistic data platform that will include product and telemetry data, amongst others.
Then you will not just be seeing members in crowd.dev, you will have users, customers, leads... It was time for a more inclusive term: contacts. This week, we have refactored the UI to reflect this change. Functionality is still the same; only words changed.

We also made sure your old links and notifications work. However, the API is still using members as the naming. We will make this switch soon.

## We dropped _Growth_ in favour of _Scale_ <PullRequest number="1618"/>

Last month, we decided to stop offering the _Growth_ plan in favor of _Scale_ to maximize the value we can offer our customers (existing _Growth_ customers will be grandfathered). This week, we shipped the relevant changes to the app to reflect this. We changed the calls to action and pricing pages and deprecated the reverse trial logic. To get a trial of everything that _Scale_ offers, please [contact us](https://cal.com/team/CrowdDotDev/custom-plan?date=2023-10-12&month=2023-10)!

## Whole new onboarding with more focus on integrations <PullRequest number="1578"/>

In our user research, we realized that customers who connect at least data sources get the value of crowd.dev easily and activated quickly. However, our old onboarding needed more attention to integrations, and several users never connected a data source.

We have re-designed it to make it clear to the user that connecting an integration is vital to get crowd.dev's value, and we improved the user experience.
