If several developers working at the same organization are interacting with your brand - your go-to-market team will want to know. In crowd.dev you can find out just that in your organization directory. 

In the past weeks, we improved activity affiliations for community members so that they took into account past work places. 
Nailing this relation is important because having a correct affiliation is necessary for a clean signal of which organizations in your community might be more interested in your open-source offering.

Until now, all activities of a certain community member, were automatically associated with the current organization of that member.. But what if the member switched workplaces? If John worked for Hooli until May 2023 and then moved to Pied Piper, his activities until May 2023 should be related to Hooli and then to Pied Piper. Since we released the ability to view the entire work history of community members some weeks ago, we now were able to build an affiliation system for activities and organizations based on these work experiences.

### We cleaned up your organizations <PullRequest number="1340"/>
When we released the employment history for members, the number of organizations we had multiplied, which caused the organizations' directory to get polluted with data that might not be relevant, such as organizations that never had any activity in your community. Having correct activity affiliations allowed us to clean this up. We filtered out all organizations with no activity and changed the sorting so you always get the organization that was last active first.

### Improved performance of the organizations' directory <PullRequest number="1328"/>
The organizations' directory suffered from speed issues in the past weeks. We synced all the organization data to OpenSearch, just like we did for members, for fast loading times. Your organization experience should now be much faster!

### Next steps
The correct affiliations, the improved performance, and the leaner and more targeted directory yielded a much better user experience for organizations. We plan to improve it further by allowing you to merge organizations and get merge suggestions in the next few weeks. We will also improve the enrichment we offer with more data points. Stay tuned!
