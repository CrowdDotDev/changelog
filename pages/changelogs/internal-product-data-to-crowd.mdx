Last week we released our Hubspot automation that will allow you to leverage crowd.dev to bring your community insights into HubSpot
to get visibility on most customers' buying journey, from first discovery through community channels, to adoption, to conversion.

This week we are experimenting by further exploring our vision of centralizing community, product, and customer data for open-source products.
We added our internal product data to our crowd.dev account.

The process is seamless: we mapped users to community members, events to activities, and workspaces to organizations.
Since we have each user's full name and email, it's pretty easy for our merging suggestions algorithm to find matches from most users to community members in GitHub and other community platforms.

Over the next few weeks, we will spend some effort cleaning up this data and ensuring most identities are resolved and unified. Then, crowd.dev will become even more potent for us. We will be able to identify users by an aggregate level of product and community activity, identify potential accounts for our Growth and Scale plans, and identify customers that might be struggling or unhappy.

Product data in crowd.dev is still an experiment; we will not be rolling it out as a feature for all users. However, if you would like to join us in
this trial, feel free to [reach out to us](https://cal.com/team/CrowdDotDev/custom-plan), and we can discuss how to set it up for your workspace.
