This week, we're bidding farewell to our Community Help Center feature.
As a dedicated team, our priority is to continuously enhance our product to better serve your needs.
This means revisiting our features and ensuring they provide the utmost value to you.
Unfortunately, the Community Help Center didn't gain the traction we had hoped for,
and we've decided to sunset it to allocate our limited resources toward features that align more with our vision and your requests.
We deeply appreciate your understanding as we focus on delivering a more intuitive and efficient product experience.
For those who valued the Community Help Center, don't worry - just reach [out to us](mailto:help@crowd.dev) and we'll gladly lend a hand
in setting up a similar solution tailored to your needs.

## Our new integrations are being rolled out progressively

Two weeks ago we announced that we were working on a new integration framework to improve the reliability and performance of our integrations.
We're glad to announce that we have started rolling it out for the LinkedIn, DEV, and Stack Overflow integrations.
Over the next week or two we'll be rolling it out to the rest of our integrations.

Since we are dealing with a lot of external data, errors sometimes are inevitable.
However, our process for handling and reacting to these errors needed some love.
We improved our alerting system to notify the team internally when anything goes wrong with an integration.
Once an integration fails, we will be notified and will move quickly to resolve the issue, before you even notice it.

## Working on speed optimizations

Some of you have noticed that lately, crowd.dev has been slow. We've been working on improving the speed of our application,
but the truth is some of the improvements we've tried haven't worked. We have now identified a solution that we are confident will work.
We are optimistic that we will have good news to share with you in two weeks.
In the meantime, we would like to thank you for your patience and understanding.
